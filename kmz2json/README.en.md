# kmz2json

Designed to convert **kmz** files (it can export layers from google maps) to **json**.

## The order of use

1. Download the archive.
2. Install the required packages:

```bash
npm i
```

3. Create a directory **input** and place the primary files in the format **kmz**.
4. Follow the command to perform the conversion

```bash
npm run convert
```

When the script is finished, the converted files in **json** format will be placed in the **output** directory.

I hope you find this little script useful.
